.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
simple shell second project for holberton school 2019 first cohort in tunisia
.SH DESCRIPTION
The shell is a program that receives computer commands given by a user from his keyboard to send to the operating system that will execute
them.
In the early days of computing, the shell was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, with the
arrival of the mouse, all computers use graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as macOS or Windows 10, in addition to command line interfaces
(CLI, for "command line interface "), like the shell.

The word "shell" is used here as a metaphor. Shell means shell or shell in French: unlike the kernel of a computer, the shell refers to
the highest layer of all interfaces of Unix systems (Linux, macOS)
